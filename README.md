# homeWork

The backend is the same as in the training sessions, i choose that backend because i already had experience in it.

For the frontEnd connecting i choose angular as it seemed easy at the begining but i had some problems installing it and everything.


I choose to have only 3 pages one home.html that creates the accounts, getall.html that shows all the accounts in the database (you can delete 
or edit the accounts ) and the last one edit.html that lets you edit a specific account. You cannot change the accounts to be edited, to do 
that you need to go on all acounts and choose the account you want to edit.
